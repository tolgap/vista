  <p>Welcome. This is the overview application to view all your Wordpress install information, if you have any data already in the database of course. To get a better detail and to see which plugins need updates, click on one of your servers:</p>
  <p>If you already have set up a <a href="https://github.com/tolgap/wp-vista-collector">Collector</a> and haven't ran it yet, give it a run by going to it's directory and running <code>rake collect_all</code></p>
